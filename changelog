0.5.0.0 Chris Dornan <chrisd@irisconnect.co.uk> 2014-07-27
	* expose getKeystore, getState, getCtxState, putCtxState in Data.KeyStore.IO
	* add proxy arguments to verifyKeystore & locateKeys in Data.KeyStore.Sections
	* opened up the export of Data.KeyStore.Types
	* added getSettingsOpt' to Data.KeyStore.KS.Opt
	* Fix #1, (section, key and host prefixes)
	* NB: this release will auto-migrate a keystore reformating the identifers
	  to life the 'no-prefixes' restrictions BUT:
	    + the change of format will only persist when the store is written
	      back, which usually only happens on an edit operation that
	      changes the keystore (e.g., by rotating a key) or, better, by forcing
	      the kmeystore to be written back);
	    + the keystore's (detached) signature will not be migrated
	      but you will have to re-sign the keystore after it has been
	      reformatted anyway; your best bet is to remove the signature (to prevent
	      an error arising from the failure to find the signing key under
	      its old name, (mis)identified in the signature) and resigning the
	      store.

	  For example, to migrate the example store, you could do something like this:

	      $ rm deploy-keystore.hash
	      $ deploy -w sign
